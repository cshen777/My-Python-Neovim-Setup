Follow the list in the link to install Neovim.

Nvim directory:
`~/.config/nvim/init.vim`

Replace with my `init.vim` profile. Note that the python directory needs to be correct, and that often varies on machines or how python is installed.(Anaconda, etc)

Run `pip install neovim` for Python support.

In nvim, run `:checkhealth` to check if everything is fine.
